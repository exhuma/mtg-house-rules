# Draft

## Drafting Process

* Draft order switches between clockwise and counter-clockwise after each
  finished booster.
* Any "token" cards are immediately discarded and are not part of the draft.
* If the second-to-last card is a land, it is *not* discarded.
* Each player picks **two cards** on each pick.
* **Do not** pick cards just to prohibit someone else from playing it. For
  example, you are locked in for red/blue and see a powerful green card in your
  cards. **Do not** pick it just because you don't want to play against it.

## Rare & Mythic Cards

At the end of the draft, each player may pick *two* rare/mythic cards.

The rest of the rare/mythic cards are put on the table in a pool. Then,
clockwise, each player may pick one of them for the own collection.

## Commander Pool & Color Identity

If the current set is not suitable for the commander format (not enough
legendary creatures) the color-identity of any creature may be modifified using
the following rules (pick only one):

* Convert one generic mana to the color of your choice
* Add one more mana of the color of your choice

### Examples

* You have a candidate for a commander with the mana-cost <mana>2BU</mana> but
  you want to play a red/black/blue deck.
  
  **Solution:** Convert one generic to red. New mana-cost: 1RBU.
* You have a candidate for a commander with the mana-cost BU but you want to
  play a red/black/blue deck.
  
  **Solution:** Add one red mana-pip. New mana-cost: RBU.
